iOS app to track golf scores

I made this app to accompany myself throughout golf rounds to track my scores throughout the round as well as other helpful information,
such as score to par, fairways accuracy (closer to 0, the more accurate), average putt per hole, and other small stats. At this point, 
it's safe to say this is th eminimum viable application and more features and designs will be included shortly. Have fun out there!
